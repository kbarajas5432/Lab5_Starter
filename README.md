1. I would not use a unit test to test this because there are numerous components working together, which based on the Canvas Writeup, a unit test can't test how individual components interact with each other on an application/feature level. The multiple components for this example are user input, network communication, database storage, and message delivery. This is too much to figure out if any of this works when doing a unit test.
2. I would use a unit test for this example because there's only a function or method that checks for the 80 character limit can be tested on it's own to figure out if it behaves correctly. This example is considered to be a self-contained logic check and there's no need to worry about if there's other comoponents that are interacting with this question.
